# research-paper-summarizer
Uses OpenAI API to summarize research papers. A few things to note: 
1) The code has been written in Jupyter lab and since it handles file uploads as widgets, I can't get the output to be shown below the cell. It is displayed in the Jupyter lab terminal. :(
2) If you have credits in your openAI API, then you can paste your API key into the .env file.
3) The code uses the GPT-4o-model by default, you can experiment with different models.
4) Please feel free to suggest changes to the code and the output as I'm still new to LLMs. Always open to constructive criticism <3
